# PozytywnaBajka

This repo serves as a reference to the productions i've made for iOS in 2011/2012 known as "PozytywnaBajka", which were interactive games (including books) made with a proprietary game engine called [stravaganza](https://github.com/invpe/Stravaganza).
As i try to refactor, update and publish them once more - i keep this repo for managing certain requirements that are part of the publishing process.
